Tools to build and maintain the IOCCC web site

This repo holds the tools that are use to maintain the [official IOCCC web site](https://www.ioccc.org).

**HOWEVER ...** XXX

# temporary use
Currently these tools maintain the [experimental web site](https://ioccc-src.github.io/temp-test-ioccc/)
by default, via the  [temp-test-ioccc GitHub repo](https://github.com/ioccc-src/temp-test-ioccc).
These tools will redefault to using the temp-test-ioccc repo and the experimental web site
until the [official IOCCC web site](https://www.ioccc.org), via the
[IOCCC winner repo](https://github.com/ioccc-src/winner) is ready for the mass pull request/merge.


**HOWEVER ...** XXX

# Why is this repo empty?
Well, for now the alpha code is found under the [temp-test-ioccc repo tmp directory](https://github.com/ioccc-src/temp-test-ioccc/tree/master/tmp).
